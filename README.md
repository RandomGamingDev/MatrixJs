A basic javascript library for dynamic and powerful matrices based on lists wrapped around with a powerful class.

Documentation is available here: https://randomgamingdev.github.io/EzDok/#v1/%22https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomGamingDev/MatrixJs/main/documentation/documentation.dok%22/0/

An example is available here: https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/MatrixJs/blob/main/matrix.js

Dependencies:
- https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/VecJs/tree/main: This is a vector library used for managing the rows of the matrix, allowing for easy and dynamic row operations. It can be included from this cdn https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/VecJs/vec.js (again I recommend using version control), or imported manually.

To use it you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/MatrixJs/matrix.js and its dependencies (they're listed above) in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

btw stuff updates so remember to specify a version/commit for your library if you want to use a link and don't want your code to automatically update to the newest version of the library
